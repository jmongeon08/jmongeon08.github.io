# JoÃ«l Mongeon | PhD Researcher in Bioresource Engineering ðŸ”¬

Hello! I'm **JoÃ«l Mongeon**, a PhD Researcher in the Department of Bioresource Engineering at **McGill University**, working in the **Sustainable Agrifood Systems Engineering Lab (SASEL) Lab**.

My core research centers around **supply chain optimization under network uncertainties** in global and local value chains. I focus on developing computational and mathematical models to enhance the resilience, sustainability, and efficiency of logistical systems.

My work lies at the intersection between **operations research**, **system dynamics**, and **machine learning**, with a core focus on developing self-adaptive and robust decision-making models for sustainable and resilient value chains.

## ðŸ’¡ Current Research Models

I develop quantitative and computational models that integrate uncertainty, real-world constraints, and causal relationships. Some of my most recent models that I am developing include the following:

- **Sustainability-Resilience Quantification:** Leveraging **graph theory** and **network analysis** (including hybrid LCA models) to simultaneously model, compute, and optimize the inherent **sustainability-resilience trade-off** across different value chain resilience stages.

- **Stochastic Modeling & System Dynamics:** Employing probabilistic models (e.g., **Bayesian Networks**, **Monte Carlo Sampling**, and **Agent-Based Modeling**) within system dynamic models to simulate the **cascading effects of disruptive events** on value chains.

- **Prospective Network Topological Analysis:** Utilizing **hypergraph theory** and **geospatial analysis** to assess the impact of radical value chain topological shifts (e.g., protectionist trade policies) on value chain performance and resource competition.

- **Value Chain Modeling and Optimization:** Leveraging insights from **neural networks**, **multi-objective optimization**, and **time-series models** to simulate and optimize value chain operations across multiple dynamic real-world constraints and performance objectives.

- **Adaptive Decision-Making:** Developing **hybrid machine learning frameworks** (e.g., HMM + LSTM) to create proactive sustainable and resilient adaptation in value chain models.

My work is motivated by the critical need to design **intelligent, resilient, and antifragile systems** that can plan, adapt, and reason under uncertainty to address various value chain challenges.
