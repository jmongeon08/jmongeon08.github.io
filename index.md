# Jo√´l Mongeon | PhD Researcher üî¨

I'm a PhD Researcher at **McGill University** in **Bioresource Engineering (SASEL Lab)**. My work integrates **Operations Research**, **System Dynamics**, and **Machine Learning** to enhance the resilience and sustainability of complex agri-food supply chains.

My core research centers around **supply chain optimization under network uncertainties** in global and local value chains. I focus on developing computational and mathematical models to enhance the resilience, sustainability, and efficiency of logistical systems.

## üí° Core Research Focus

My research goal is to design intelligent, resilient systems capable of adapting under uncertainty. Key areas include:

* **Sustainability-Resilience Trade-Offs:** Quantifying this balance using **graph theory** and **Hybrid LCA models**.
* **Stochastic Modeling:** Simulating disruption effects using **Bayesian Networks** and **Agent-Based Modeling (ABM)**.
* **Prospective Analysis:** Utilizing **hypergraph theory** and **geospatial analysis** to assess the impact of policy shifts on network performance.
* **Adaptive Decision-Making:** Developing hybrid **HMM + LSTM** frameworks for proactive strategy adjustment.
